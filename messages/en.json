    "message": {
      "intro": "As a researcher at MIT's AI Lab and a lifelong student of human nature, I've witnessed firsthand how artificial intelligence is reshaping our world. Yet, through all this technological advancement, one truth remains clear: the essence of humanity - our creativity, empathy, wisdom, and moral reasoning - cannot be replicated by machines.",
      "philosophy": "I believe every culture holds a unique piece of wisdom essential for navigating the AI era. That's why HumanEdge Academy isn't just another online education platform. We're conducting a global experiment in human learning, understanding how different cultures, religions, and philosophical traditions approach the fundamental questions of our time.",
      "mission": "Our mission extends beyond education. We're building bridges between ancient wisdom and cutting-edge technology, between Eastern philosophy and Western innovation, between faith traditions and scientific progress. Each of our global centers serves as a laboratory where we discover how local wisdom can inform universal human development.",
      "globalVision": "Starting with South Korea in August 2025, followed by Japan, Brazil, and India, we're not simply translating courses - we're co-creating knowledge with local philosophers, religious leaders, and cultural experts. This isn't about imposing a single worldview; it's about celebrating the diversity of human thought while finding our common humanity.",
      "personalNote": "As a Christian, I draw inspiration from my faith, but I deeply respect and learn from all religious and philosophical traditions. Whether it's Confucian ethics, Buddhist mindfulness, Hindu philosophy, or secular humanism, each tradition offers invaluable insights for preserving human dignity in the age of AI.",
      "closing": "Join us in this grand experiment. Together, we'll ensure that as machines become more intelligent, humans become more human.",
